AI Career Survival Guide (2026)

A data-driven framework to evaluate career resilience during AI-driven labor market disruption.

📌 Overview

Artificial Intelligence is automating predictable, repetitive, and rule-based work — especially in entry-level digital roles.

This project builds a structured scoring model to evaluate how resilient different careers are in the AI era.

Instead of asking:

🧠 Core Hypothesis

Careers are more resilient when they combine:

Low automation feasibility

High income stability

Strong barriers to entry (certification, licensing, complexity)

High human judgment requirements

Execution scales with AI.
Judgment and authority do not.

📊 Career Resilience Model

Each career is scored across four parameters (0–10 scale):

Automation Risk

Income Stability

Barrier to Entry

Judgment Requirement

Career Resilience Score (CRS)
CRS = (Income Stability + Barrier to Entry + Judgment Requirement) − Automation Risk


Higher CRS → More structurally resilient career.
